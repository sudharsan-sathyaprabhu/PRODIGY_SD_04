#Implement a Sudoku Solver
## Description
Create a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program should take an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers.
It should use backtracking or other suitable techniques to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement of numbers for the puzzle. Once solved, the program should display the completed Sudoku grid.
